# Sudoku

# First time using git, so I'm sure I'm still making mistakes

# The project: solving a sudoku + a gui where you can try to solve it yourself
# The gui is not that user-friendly, you have to press the key you want to insert and then the cell.

# Main goal of this project was understanding backtracking more :)
